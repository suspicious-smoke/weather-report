# Installation
1. Enable I2C and SPI under raspi-config
```
sudo raspi-config
```
2. Get and install git
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```
3. Install libraries for Inky wHAT/Impression displays:
```
curl https://get.pimoroni.com/inky | bash
```
4. Install pyOWM. pyOWM is a python library that utilizes the OpenWeatherMaps APIs.
```
pip install pyowm
```
5. Copy the git repo for this project
```
git clone https://github.com/Hothomir/weather-report.git
```
6. Go to the weather-report directory
```
cd weather-report
```
7. Access configfile.ini using nano
```
nano configfile.ini
```
8. Change the values to what is preferred. Example for Philadelphia, PA:
```
[OWM_API]
api = 123456789abcdefg

[Location]
latitude = 39.952583
longitude = -75.165222
city = Philadelphia
country = US
```
9. Run the program while in the weather-report directory
```
Inky wHAT: python main.py
Inky Impression: python impression-main.py
```
# Recurring Display Refreshes
To get new weather information in timed intervals, I've used crontab. Crontab schedules when to run the main.py file and is flexible with how often it should be run.

I've set up the crontab job to run every 30 minutes, so the display will refresh every 30 minutes. Example:
1. Open crontab in terminal
```
crontab -e
```
2. At the bottom of the crontab file, provide the following line:
```
*/30 * * * * python /home/pi/weather-report/main.py
```
3. To refresh the display every 60 mins (every hour):
```
*/60 * * * * python /home/pi/weather-report/main.py
```

# To-Do
- Where the weather condition prints "Clear" in the image, it would be better to print the detailed condition for the current weather. However, need to see how to wrap text, as the detailed conditions print as one line and get cut off by the edge of the display.
